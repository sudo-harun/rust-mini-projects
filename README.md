Very simple mini-projects written in Rust

### Temperature Converter
<a href='https://github.com/sudo-harun/mini-projects/blob/main/temperature-converter/main.rs'>This</a> is a very simple temperature converter written in Rust, in which the user can specify if they want to convert to celsius from fahrenheit or vice versa. The user can then enter the value they want to convert and the program converts that value and returns the converted value.

### Fibonacci Sequence Number Generator
<a href='https://github.com/sudo-harun/mini-projects/blob/main/nth-fibo-num-gen/main.rs'>This</a> is a very simple Fibonacci sequnece number generator, which takes an nth number specified by the user and finds the value at that nth number of the Fibonacci sequence.

### Square Maker (not drawer)
<a href='https://github.com/sudo-harun/mini-projects/blob/main/square-maker/main.rs'>This</a> is a very simple program, which takes a value from the user (width or height) and creates a square with that value as the width and height (assigns it to its own struct instance [sq1]). It then calculates and returns the area of that square. Please be aware that this program does not actually draw a square onto the screen.

### Triangle Maker/Drawer
<a href='https://github.com/sudo-harun/mini-projects/blob/main/triangle-maker-1/main.rs'>This</a> is a simple triangle maker/drawer, in which the user can specify the size of the longest side of the triangle they want drawn in their terminal and draws a right angled triangle using asterisks (*).
